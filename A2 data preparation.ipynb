The 20-year-old Turkish national commandeered the plane shortly after it took off from Istanbul late Friday, forcing the Airbus A310 to divert to the Greek capital Athens from its intended destination Ankara. The Turkish Airlines plane was carrying 194 passengers and nine crew - among them several Turkish parliamentarians, a former minister and senior officials, some of whom were instrumental in bringing a bloodless end to the incident. State secretary in charge of transportation, Manolis Stratakis, said hijack suspect Ozgur Gencaslas seemed \"to have psychological problems\". Mr Stratakis told a press conference at Athens Airport the hijacker remained on board with the two pilots once he let everyone else go. Special forces arrested him when a translator went aboard to help negotiate the terms of his surrender with Greek police. In Ankara, Turkish officials said there were no apparent connections to terrorism in the hijacking, which lasted about three and a half hours. The hijacker decided to release the passengers after speaking on the telephone with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters. \"The man told us that his mother and his sister were being detained in Germany and that he was suffering,\" Mr Yildirim said. Mr Erdogan, he said, had called the mobile phone of one of the legislators on board, who then passed it to the hijacker. \"We talked intensively with him to convince him (to give himself up). I believe he felt we trusted him and he decided to end his action,\" the minister said. A relieved Greek Foreign Minister, George Papandreou, said all passengers were safe and sound. \"All the passengers are free, the families of those who were on the plane can feel reassured,\" he told Turkish news channel CNN-Turk. \"Everything went well.\" The plane landed a few minutes past 22:00GMT at Athens airport, where a tense standoff began with special forces surrounding the aircraft. Greek Government spokesman Christos Protopapas warned they would storm the plane if it became necessary. The Turkish television station had reported the hijacker had explosives with him, though Mr Yildirim strongly denied that. It would have been \"impossible to go through two security checkpoints (at Istanbul airport) with explosives\", he said, adding he did not know what kind of weapon was used to threaten the pilots. The suspect was a resident of Germany but travelled regularly to Turkey. Problems connected with his military service in Turkey had prevented him from leaving.\\n',\n",

The boat carrying about 50 passengers, believed to be Vietnamese, was intercepted yesterday by the Port Hedland Port Authority rather than Coastwatch or navy surveillance crews. It is the first intercepted vessel near Australia since December 2001. The group will be transported to a detention centre at Christmas Island for questioning by immigration authorities. Mr Ruddock says surveillance teams had been on alert for a vessel sighted in the region last month. He says there will be an inquiry into any shortcomings in border patrols. \"We manage the border control issues very comprehensively, but because you do that doesn\\'t mean that there won\\'t be occasions in which a vessel might breach those arrangements in the way in which it has,\" he said. \"I don\\'t seek to blame people about these matters, I mean you\\'re looking at a very large ocean and sometimes quite small boats.\" He says it is an isolated incident. But the Federal Opposition says if Australia had a dedicated coast guard, the boat would not have come within a few kilometres of the coast. Labor\\'s Mark Latham says defence resources are being stretched and a coast guard would provide better border protection. \"The Navy can\\'t do everything, they can\\'t be fighting wars committed on the other side of the world, committed in the Solomons and other places, and still have effective coastal surveillance and coastal policing in place,\" Mr Latham said. \"We really do need a dedicated service that will do the job properly.\" The Australian Democrats say the boat\\'s arrival indicates millions of dollars are being wasted on surveillance operations. Democrats leader Andrew Bartlett says taxpayers\\' money should be redirected to more serious problems. \"We\\'re continuing to waste enormous amounts of money, millions and millions of dollars, unnecessarily scanning for asylum seekers who obviously, it would now seem, can get through that screening anyway, when we should be looking at issues that are a real threat such as drug smuggling,\" Senator Bartlett said. Federal Justice Minister Senator Chris Ellison has backed Mr Ruddock, saying Australia\\'s border protection mechanisms are working effectively. \"We believe this is a one-off situation and you have to remember we had great cooperation from Indonesia,\" he said. \"They\\'ve got two vessels which are being processed in Indonesia. \"We\\'ve no evidence to indicate this represents a systemic change but of course what it does say is that you can\\'t be complacent. \"We believe that people smugglers are always looking for opportunities.\" Mr Ruddock says the asylum seekers\\' claims will be processed on Christmas Island because it will deliver the fairest and quickest outcome. Greens Senator Bob Brown has labelled the move \"the original One Nation solution\", saying the Immigration Department is denying asylum seekers access to Australian law. Senator Brown says the group has come from Vietnam, described by the United States as a repressive state with a poor human rights record. But Mr Ruddock says it is likely the people are economic refugees and processing their claims outside Australia\\'s migration zone means there will not be drawn-out appeals and court claims. \"The longer you keep people here, the more you build up expectations amongst others - maybe they have achieved something,\" he said. \"That\\'s the rationale behind wanting to deal with these issues fairly, properly, but promptly.\" The federal president of a Vietnamese community group is concerned the boat\\'s passengers will not get fair treatment because Australia does not recognise the human rights abuses he says are occuring in Vietnam. Trung Doan from Vietnamese Community Australia says taking the asylum seekers to Christmas Island will limit their rights. \"I\\'m concerned that Immigration Department officials may, either out of prejudice or out of lack of knowledge about the human rights abuses in Vietnam, may wrongly reject them,\" he said. \"And because they\\'re in an excise zone, they have no opportunity to be reheard.\" Refugee advocate Marion Le agrees the decision to move the detainees to Christmas Island raises fresh concerns about the Government\\'s mandatory detention policy. \"Why are they being escorted back to Christmas Island when in the past people are just taken straight on to Port Hedland where of course we have a long-term detention centre?\" Judith McVeigh from the Victorian Refugee Action Collective says the people on board the boat should be given access to Australian courts to apply for asylum. \"It looks like this boat has made it to Australian territory and they should have access to Australian courts,\" she said.\\n',\n",
